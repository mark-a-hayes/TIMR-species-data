# TIMR-species-data

This repository contains species occurrence data to support footnote 10 in Hayes at al. (2019; TIMR manuscript EAP 1881). These data were 
extracted from the USGS Bat Population Database (BPD; https://my.usgs.gov/bpd/) on March 21, 2019 for each of the following species: 
little brown bat; northern long-eared bat; big brown bat; tri-colored bat; silver-haired bat; hoary bat; and eastern red bat. 

BPD searches used the following search parameters:
Country: United States
State: Either Wisconsin or "All States"
Date Range: 1800-2019
Bat Species: each species was searched individually
Data Project: All Data Projects

Once each search was completed, the "Captures" data were exported as a csv file. Total counts data was not used for the purposes here. 

Files are named by four letter species acronymn and the extent of the search. 
For example, "epfu_wi" means a search for Eptesicus fuscus in Wisconsin, while "laci_us" means a search for all states 
within the United States.
